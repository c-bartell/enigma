[Criteria](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma/rubric)

1. Functionality: 3
  * The enigma class, #encrypt, #decrypt, and CLI are successfully implemented

2. OOP: 3
  * I think that my program structure is logical, and I think that my classed maintain single responsibility.

3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 4
  * I think that I managed to keep everything clean, legible, and idiomatic.

4. TDD: 3 or 4
  * My tests utilized mocks and stubs where appropriate, and all methods are tested. My last two integration tests in enigma are slightly long, but they work as intended. Test coverage is 100% and all methods were written after corresponding tests.

5. Version Control: 4
  * My pull requests were logical and my commits were descriptive, thorough, numerous, and contained singular pieces of functionality.

  There is always more that can be improved upon, but, all in all, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in the time given.
